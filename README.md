# BundleDirect
This is an unofficial port of [Bundle Jumble](https://modrinth.com/mod/bundle-jumble) to NeoForge 1.21.1.

## Features
- Right-clicking with a bundle will place a random block from the bundle
- Throwing out all items now requires holding shift
- If your bundle runs out of a block, it checks your inventory if you have more of that item and automatically refills your bundle
- If that's not the case, you'll get a message saying you've run out of that block
- Adds a recipe for the bundle, using either leather or rabbit hide
- Rabbits now have the possibility to get up to 3 babies when breeding them, making it easier to get rabbit hide (You monster!)

## Differences from Bundle Jumble
- BundleDirect uses the newer bundle recipe (one string and one leather/rabbit hide) instead of the older one which requires 2 string and 6 leather/hide.
- Dyed bundles have not been added
- Readded the bundle to the creative inventory under 'Tools'
- Config options
